I'm currently a Researcher at OpenAI, focus on Multimodal. I was a Senior Research Scientist at ByteDance Seed. I was a senior applied scientist at Microsoft Azure AI Computer Vision Team. 
Before joining Microsoft, I received my M.S. degree from Duke University. I received my B.S. degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research experiences in various areas are more or less related to computer vision, multi-modal, reinforcement learning and deep learning.
